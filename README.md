# Movie-website
This is my first try on HTML/CSS.

Download the files.
Put all images into a folder called img, and the rest of the files can just be in 1 folder.
Right click the index.html file and open it in any browser.

I know that it is very many files and with the help of java script i could make it into 1 file that changes its look depending on the movie clicked on.
